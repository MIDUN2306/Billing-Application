# Quick Start: Sales vs Expenses Chart

## What You'll See

A new chart at the bottom of your dashboard showing:
- **Red bars**: Your daily expenses (petty cash + raw materials)
- **Green bars**: Your daily sales revenue
- **Badge at top**: Total profit or loss for the period

## How to Use It

### 1. View the Chart
Navigate to the Dashboard page - the chart appears at the bottom, below the other two charts.

### 2. Understand the Bars
- **Each day has 2 bars side by side**:
  - Left bar (red) = Total expenses for that day
  - Right bar (green) = Total sales for that day
- **Taller green bar = Profit** ✅
- **Taller red bar = Loss** ❌

### 3. Check Profit/Loss
Look at the badge at the top right of the chart:
- Green badge = You're making profit! 🎉
- Red badge = You're in loss (need to improve)

### 4. Use Date Filters
Change the date range using the filter at the top of the dashboard:
- Today
- Yesterday
- This Week
- This Month
- Custom Range

The chart updates automatically!

### 5. Read Summary Stats
Below the chart, you'll see 4 key numbers:
1. **Total Expenses**: All money spent in the period
2. **Total Sales**: All money earned in the period
3. **Profit Days**: How many days you made profit
4. **Loss Days**: How many days you had losses

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: Good Day
```
Sales (green): ₹20,000
Expenses (red): ₹10,000
Result: ₹10,000 profit ✅
```

### Example 2: Bad Day
```
Sales (green): ₹8,000
Expenses (red): ₹15,000
Result: ₹7,000 loss ❌
```

## What the Expenses Include

The red bar combines:
1. **Petty Cash**: Money given to staff for small expenses
2. **Raw Materials**: Cost of milk, tea powder, sugar, etc.

## Tips for Success

1. **Aim for green bars taller than red bars** every day
2. **Watch for patterns**: Which days are most profitable?
3. **Control expenses**: Keep red bars consistent and low
4. **Increase sales**: Focus on growing green bars
5. **Use the data**: Make informed business decisions

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Numbers don't match my records**
