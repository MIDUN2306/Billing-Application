## How to Read It

### The Bars
- **Red Bar (Left)** = All your expenses
  - Petty cash given out
  - Raw materials purchased
  
- **Green Bar (Right)** = All your sales
  - Money earned from customers

### The Result
- **Green bar taller** = You made PROFIT ✅
- **Red bar taller** = You had LOSS ❌
- **Same height** = Break-even ⚖️

### The Badge (Top Right)
- **Green badge** = Profit amount
- **Red badge** = Loss amount

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: Good Business ✅
```
Red bar:  ₹10,000 (expenses)
Green bar: ₹20,000 (sales)
Badge: "Profit: ₹10,000" (green)
```
**Meaning**: You spent ₹10K and earned ₹20K = ₹10K profit!

### Example 2: Need Improvement ❌
```
Red bar:  ₹15,000 (expenses)
Green bar: ₹8,000 (sales)
Badge: "Loss: ₹7,000" (red)
```
**Meaning**: You spent ₹15K but only earned ₹8K = ₹7K loss!
